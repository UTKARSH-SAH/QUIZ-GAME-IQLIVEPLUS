IQ LIVE PLUS PROJECT
Introduction
IQ Live Plus as a game project aims to test and enhance knowledge of player and to accurately predict the IQ of the player according to the international standards, it also provides players with features like Lifelines, Award Prize, Minigame and Difficulty Choice.

Literature Study
1.	Why we choose this project?
We choose this project because it gave us a chance to implement C++ and   discover new possibilities with the language and also to work upon quiz based game which is able to predict iq in a fun way for users which also enhaces their knowledge.
2.	How is our project better than other projects?
Our project is better than other projects in same domain on many grounds as our project randomizes questions thus making cheating difficult and provides lifelines for convenience and ability to quit game in between abd also because our project has extensive case checking where user is not able to exploit loopholes to an unfair advantage and it not only does provide user with IQ score but also accesses whether iq is high, low or medium and grants user with award prize. The project also contains a minigame that a user can play for fun.

Methodology:
Our programming methodology involves use of C and C++ standard library functions, class and object concept and creation of own functions within and outside class.
